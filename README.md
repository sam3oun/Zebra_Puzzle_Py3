# Zebra Puzzle Solution in Python3
I've been using Git for a long time but never actually shared any code, so I just decided to start using it for fun, I was bored and i saw the Zebra Puzzle somewhere online and decided to solve it. 
(for more info visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_Puzzle) 

Actually it was easy I did some analysis at first to ensure that the runtime wouldn't take a long time and did it in like 2 hours i think(with Coffee breaks included), so feel free to take it, play around with it, do whatever you want.

Cheers.
